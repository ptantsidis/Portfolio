     Taking influences from jazz, funk, and heavy rock creating a revolutionary monstor of a drummer.
     Hi drumming was called loud and abnoxious from his early gigging days before Zeppelin  until he was so important that would not go on without him. 
     From the first jam of "Train kKept a Rollin'"" they just knew this is something special.</p>
